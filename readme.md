# What is CP GFG?

_This is practise of Competitive Programming as learned by me via a Geeks for Geeks Course. Questions and problems are solved in broadly 2 ways._

1. Basic
2. Efficient

_Both ways are absolutely correct. However what they are different in is their efficiency!_
_It is not necessary that the efficient solution is more efficient than the basic one solely on the running time complexity._
